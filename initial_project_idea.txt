My application will allow users to search articles from sources of their choosing. From there they will be able to save articles to read later to a mutable reading list. Users will be able to see all of the different articles searched for as well the sources. Users will also be able to query articles based on previous search terms and different sources. This is a little bit like a social media application for sharing and finding news. It has diverse functionality in that users can access specific sources or multiple sources at their discretion. I will build the app to access the New API in order to do all of these things and store the returned data to tables in a database. There are a two many-to-many relationships I am building with association tables between the users and reading lists, articles and reading lists. There is also a many-to-many relationship I am building through two many-to-one relationships in their respective models between articles and their source with articles for each source. There is also a one-to-many relationship between a user and their reading list.
